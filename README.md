# FYS-3730 Project Paper
This project was carried out in collaboration with _Integrated Detector Electronics AS_ (IDEAS)
## Description
Within this project, the _GDS-100_ and the library _MEGAlib_ will be used to do Compton collimation
to prove and characterize the system’s capabilities. A data processing method has been
proposed to ensure that the GDS-100 data can be integrated with MEGAlib. The system’s capabilities
are shown through the number of events measured, times used, and seeing when a source
is detectable or not. By utilizing the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of angular resolution
measure (ARM), there is a method to evaluate and verify the results. This will be evaluated
through two tests, which are the walking radiation source test and the environmental monitoring
test. Across the two tests, the best angular resolution recorded was ≈ 19◦ FWHM, achieved
within a measuring time of 20 minutes. Further work, for characterizing data and improving
spectral and spatial resolution is proposed.
